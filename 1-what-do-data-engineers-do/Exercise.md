## Questions: Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start?

I will start by arranging meeting with the data downstream users (data analytics) to undertand their goals and objectives from the data. So, I plan to do the following steps:

1. **Understand the Requirement:** I can achieve this by working in iteration with the the data downstram users.
2. **Understand the data source:** I will study the data source catalogue and metatdata if any, and I will also meet the data upstream persons.
3. **Identify key metrics and KPI:** Based on business objectives, I would work to identify the key performance indicators.
4. **Map the data source:** After defining the necessary metrics, I would evaluate what data is needed and where itâ€™s stored
5. **Develop Data Architecture:** I will develop the data achitecure that will serve as a guide for the project.
6. **Build the data Pipeline:** I will execute all the plan and report my progress. Then iterate based on feedback.
